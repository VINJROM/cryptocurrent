This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app "React.js"). Check out the preview page [here](https://cryptocurrent-dashboard.herokuapp.com/ "CryptoCurrent").

# CryptoCurrent Dashboard
This application utilizes React, Highcharts, and CryptocCompare API to display current CryptoCurrencies in graphical format.

## Feature Overview
CryptoCurrent is a quick way to browse, favorite, and display CryptoCurrency values over a span of days, weeks, and months.

## Motivation
This project is part of React.School React Project Tutorials in which students utilize their React.js, CSS Grid, HighCharts, CryptoCompare API, and localStorage-accessing capabilities.

## Result
I learned how to connect React.js to CryptoCompare API and use React's callback functions to visulally display targeted API values.
The result is a CryptoCurrency Financial Reporting App where users can use to quickly browse, save, and fetch CryptoCurrency data.

## Technologies Used
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/ "React.js"). A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/demo "HighCharts") - Set up interactive charts to graph historical data.

- [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ "CryptoCompare API") - Fetch current CryptoCurrency price data.

- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/ "Moment") - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.
